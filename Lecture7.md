## Visualizing Real-Time Language-Based Feedback on Teamwork Behavior in Computer-Mediated Groups
### 1) a two sentence summary (do *not* simply summarize the work in your write-up)
The paper details the experiment of a group conversation system which gives real time feedback on language use for participants. The authors have figured out that the system helps in improving the agreement in group communications and elicits behavioral changes in the participants.    

### 2) what you feel are the positives of the work, i.e. what is exceptional
I think their study was useful in looking at the language use in an computer mediated groups and coming up with a real time feedback on linguistic usage. This aspect is novel and is different from showing other statistics about the number of participants in the system etc. They also looked closely at the fact that excessive feedback will hold back people from focusing on the task at hand and hence will make the system less useful.    

### 3) what you think could use improvement
I think one of the drawback which the model suffers from is usage of the LIWC system for chat messages. Chat messages are themselves very unstructured and using regular linguistic tools might at times give misleading results. I think this should be improved by using a specialized linguistic tool for chat messages.     

### 4) how you might continue the work or what you might pursue next
I think the system is quite useful and can be further developed by first, including a chat specific linguistic tool for better inference. Also, another part which can have improvement is limiting the visualization at the bottom to be just the top k participants so as reduce clutter if there are huge number of participants.

## Making the Connection: Social Bonding in Courtship Situations
### 1) a two sentence summary (do *not* simply summarize the work in your write-up)
The paper discusses the phenomenon of social bonding especially in the context of  hetrosexual relationships. They look at speed dating couples and come to a conclusion that the bonding is most efficient when the female is the focus of conversation and the males are aligned and understand the female. In the game of courtship you either bond or you remain single.

### 2) what you feel are the positives of the work, i.e. what is exceptional
I think the important theme of this paper is looking at hetrosexual speed dating from a game theoretic and trying to come up with parameters which affect the final result which is weather the bonding happens or not. They have also tried to look at the factors from the individual actor perspective like what factors help male bonding and what affect female bonding. They have also chosen the speed dating scenario because of the availability of a huge a rich data set. They present a rich and useful corpus for further study. They have done a statistical feature analysis which is really useful and also includes features of the voice pitch along with linguistic and survey based features.

### 3) what you think could use improvement
I think the basis experiment in the study is something which is not representative of long term relationships. People merely don't bond much over a speed date but the relationship grows over a time. In fact the charm in a speed date might die after sometime and another individual who looked not that interesting might appear to be more complimentary in the long run.    

### 4) how you might continue the work or what you might pursue next
Even though it is practically tough, but I would still want to further this research by studying the couples for a longer duration or in a multiple date setting where they can share bit more than the speed date scenario. Also, I would like to look into external features like the background, profile, job area etc of each of the actors and see if similar attracts similar are exhibited in that.
