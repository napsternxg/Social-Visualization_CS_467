## In Situ Speech Visualization in Real-Time Interactive Installation and Performance
### 1) a two sentence summary (do *not* simply summarize the work in your write-up)
The paper describes techniques employed to visualize speech of users using an augmented reality equipment. The authors utilize the concepts of speech representation as 3D shapes which are closely coupled with the pitch, timbre and volume of the visitor. In another experiment they show the representation of sound words in space. 

### 2) what you feel are the positives of the work, i.e. what is exceptional
The work presented in the paper has a very artistic appeal and can be utilized for creating useful art forms. The authors have build up the paper from great examples of the movie Reci Reci Reci and have closed with the performance of their installations by the artists. 

### 3) what you think could use improvement
The paper could have been improved by explaining a bit of the mathematical transformation of the speech to the various shapes and what is the relevance of each of the given techniques from a social usage perspective. 

### 4) how you might continue the work or what you might pursue next
I think the paper can be continued by exploring various mathematical functions and transformations which can better render the various features of the language like sentiment, topics, context etc. Also usage of colors to define the tone can be a useful improvement. 

## Social Mirrors as Social Signals: Transforming Audio into Graphics
### 1) a two sentence summary (do *not* simply summarize the work in your write-up)
The paper describes a social visualization approach to augment group visualizations. The techniques is helpful in understanding the development of ideas in a group visualization over time and also an addition of anonymous input.

### 2) what you feel are the positives of the work, i.e. what is exceptional
The paper nicely puts forth the idea of abstracting the actual text of conversation with graphical information so as to allow for the difference frame of reference of each individual leading to a more common understanding and recall of the conversation. The conversation clock captures this concept nicely and shows a clear evolution of the conversation around a table. Some nice points were about people improving their language usage by looking at the clock. The further improve it by moving from volume of sound to important of statements using the anonymous voting feature. Finally the clustering based on words was interesting in depicting evolution of ideas. 

### 3) what you think could use improvement
I think the work can be improved by using more sophisticated language and speech modelling techniques to show more features of the conversation. I also feel the paper can be improved by adding the user feedback snippets like conversation clock for the other 2 experiments as well. 

### 4) how you might continue the work or what you might pursue next
I would want to improve the work by also looking at the social network structure evolution of groups based on the communication happening. Which users start to form clusters and are more agreeing with each other. This can be useful in understanding which subgroups are formed which can drive the opinion in the whole group.
