For each of the visualizations, please write a half page explanation for why you found this visualization compelling. Please do not simply summarize the visualization. Give a brief 1-2 sentence summary and then discuss what works well and what may be confusing. Finally, address how you might continue or modify each visualization. Please include a link to the visualization. Feel free to include screenshots in the write-up!
Please make note of the following in your explanations:
the data represented. Why is it interesting? Is it personal?
the interactive elements (such as transitions) of the visualization, if any
the legibility of the visualization - is it easy to comprehend and understand?
story - does it tell a story that does not require paragraphs of text to interpret?
exploration - does it encourage exploration?
aesthetics - color, typography, overall aesthetics of the visualization


## Visualization #1: why did you find this visualization compelling?


### Link:

http://HubCab.org

### 1-2 sentence summary:

The visualization is interesting in the way that it shows the movement of life in New York City onto a map if we consider a huge amount of people using Taxis in the city. This is of particular interest as taxis are mostly used by tourists and people of business class so looking at the map at various time sections of the day gives insights about the popularity of areas. 

### What works well? 

It has map like transitions along with interactive elements to get info about taxi trips between 2 specific points on the map. Putting the pickup pointer restricts the map to only places linked to that pickup location which serves as showing the network connected to that place.
The visualization tells the story of New York City’s life movement. It tries to prove using data the benefits of cab sharing between specific locations. One of the interesting insight I got was about the statement that “New York City never sleeps” as all throughout the day you can see taxi usage in the island area.
The easy to use interface allows only people well versed with the places in NYC to explore into their favorite locations. From the map it appears Museum of Modern Art and Times Square are top pick up locations (probably they mark the end of the tour). 

### What is confusing?

Aesthetically the visualization is easy to read from macroscopic level. However, compared to google maps granular information is lost when zooming in.
Macroscopically it gives a good feel of which areas are popular pickup and drop off locations however, since the visualization is just points plotted on the map, hence on zooming in one gets a lot of noisy data.   
How would you continue or modify this visualization?

I believe an addition of a search button would make the visualization usable to even those who just know names of places in the city.
   

## Visualization #2: why did you find this visualization compelling?
### Link:
http://sorting.at/

### 1-2 sentence summary:

The visualization is dynamic representation of various sorting algorithms and how the element swaps occur as time progresses. 

### What works well?

The visualization is educationally beautiful and useful as it explains how the various sorting algorithms work including the element movements in each of them and an insight into the complexity of the algorithm.
One can select a flavor of the algorithm along with conditions like number of elements, color of visualization and initial sort condition of the array. This gives a wide range of variations to try out.
The play button allows adds a nice interactive feature as you can have multiple algorithms being visualized simultaneously which helps in knowing which steps of the algorithm are faster compared to others.
The visualization is quite simple to understand and try out as it is made especially for educational purposes.
We get to choose from nice visually appealing pastel style colors which make it easy to read the visualization and a black background keeps it soothing for the eyes. 

### What is confusing?

For arrays bigger than size 20 the visualization gets very fuzzy as it doesn't use all of the screen space.
Algorithms like quicksort and merge sort which split the array into two parts are not visualized properly as the splitting and merging parts is not distinctly shown. 

### How would you continue or modify this visualization?

It would have been great to have a feature to add your own unsorted array into the algorithm and see it being visualized as that would make the page much more exploratory and interactive. 
Add the splitting and merging visualization to respective sort functions.

## Visualization #3: why did you find this visualization compelling?

### 1-2 sentence summary:
This is an audio visual representation of the edits happening on Wikipedia, The visualization plays a different note of music and adds a bubble of specific radius depending on the size of the edit. Old edits fade back. 

### What works well?

The visualization does a great job of communicating both visually and in music the amount of edits happening on wikipedia. The more frequent the edits the faster the music will go. Looking at it we can see which pages are exactly being edited and with how much data. You can see the origin of new pages and also representation of frequent edit wars. 
The visualization both visually and in music differentiates on the kinds of edits i.e. addition and subtraction of content. New users joining the site are also showcased. The visualization is useful when you want to track things using audio while you want to use your screen space for some other task. 
The music is really soothing to the ears and that is the best side of the visualization. It doubles as a good background music for studying =)

### What is confusing?
The positioning of the bubbles is a bit confusing as the position doesn't give any information about the page. Also the visualization is of all of wikipedia hence it becomes less useful for people looking to restrict their information to specific sections of wikipedia like social movements and viral themes. 
How would you continue or modify this visualization?
I would like to add modification which allow you to restrict the space to a given category and try to study those. Another feature would be to distinguish the creation of new pages more uniquely.
