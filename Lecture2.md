## The Eyes Have It: A Task by Data Type Taxonomy for Information Visualizations
### 1) a two sentence summary (do *not* simply summarize the work in your write-up)
The paper presents a set of useful tasks which can be applied when visualizing various data-types (1-d,2-d,3-d, temporal and multivariate, tree, network). It builds up on the philosophy of data visualization called: overview, zoom and filter, details on demand.

### 2) what you feel are the positives of the work, i.e. what is exceptional
The paper does a great job at identifying and categorizing the various data types in visualization based on tasks required to visualize them. It uses these 7 basic datatypes as building blocks for other data types. Differentiation, especially between 1-d and temporal data, tree and network data with focus on how specific visualization techniques they use is very useful for the reader to progress forth in the paper.  The author also points out the importance of some of the frequently missed tasks in data visualization, like, allowing for undo and replay in interactive visualization and extraction of subset of data from the visualization. The filter-flow model for visualizing Boolean data was particularly interesting and quite useful.
This distinction between English and Boolean AND and OR operators was also interesting and something I have never given thought to.

### 3) what you think could use improvement
I think it would have been interesting to know the author's view on how the various tasks play with the different datatypes and what mixing of tasks and datatypes are most suitable and which ones are redundant.     

### 4) how you might continue the work or what you might pursue next
The paper inspires us to look as data-sets for visualization is a more categorical way. This is useful in trying to come up with a programming language like approach towards working with data visualization. D3.js is an example of using some of the concepts in the paper to build a visualization programming language. I would want to look deeper into how these tasks (operators)   and data types (operands) play with each other and what data attributes affect these.


## Visualization Rhetoric: Framing Effects in Narrative Visualization
### 1) a two sentence summary (do *not* simply summarize the work in your write-up)
The paper tries to explain how various forms of visualizations are used in telling a story and what factors influence the interpretation of the visualization by the user. The paper builds an analytical framework for the discussion of the rhetorical aspects of information visualization.

### 2) what you feel are the positives of the work, i.e. what is exceptional
An explanation of editorial layers dealing with the choice of addition or deletion of information present on the visualization, as one of the factors in the interpretation of the visualization is interesting. The 4 rhetoric functioning were useful in explaining the various ways parts of visualization tell a story. Looking at the language usage in a visualization was interesting as that is something which is likely to be missed when analyzing a visualization but affects the story telling process hugely. Using their coding technique they have presented the top 10 prevalent visualization techniques. 
The case studies presented in the paper are useful in understanding the framework proposed by the authors in contact of real examples.

### 3) what you think could use improvement

The paper does a good job of describing the framework but since looking at visualization as a narrative automatically makes it a decision affecting tool hence it could have also focused on the psychological effects and how positively or negatively do each of the functions describe in the paper affect the decision making.

### 4) how you might continue the work or what you might pursue next
An interesting extension of their framework would be to see how visualization affect community decision making process. Do visualizations which are biased and entertaining get talked about and referenced in news more than other ones ?
