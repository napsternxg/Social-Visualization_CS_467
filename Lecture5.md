## Studying Cooperation and Conflict between Authors with History Flow Visualizations
### 1) a two sentence summary (do *not* simply summarize the work in your write-up)
The paper describes a novel and useful technique for looking at the edit history of wiki like pages and to make broad tends more visually distinct.  It can visualize the edit history using the history flow visualization method which allows for identifying which user was influential in edits and what was the survival duration of each edit. 

### 2) what you feel are the positives of the work, i.e. what is exceptional
The technique proposed for visualizing such huge data sets is really simple and effective. It satisfies the principle of overview, zoom and details. The flow connection technique is quite useful in understanding what remains same during various versions.    

### 3) what you think could use improvement
One of the things which even the paper points out for improvement is identifying similar objects in the text and understanding what we define as change. An addition of comma can be considered a change from linguistic's point of view but for a data scientist that will only act as noisy data.    

### 4) how you might continue the work or what you might pursue next
I would suggest using some machine learning techniques to do fuzzy matching of revisions and identifying these history flows based on what are the objects of interest to the end user. This can include things like looking at edits at section level, or only edits greater than certain characters. I would also suggest on adding suggestions for pointing out media history on a wiki page. When was a picture or a video or music added, this will take this visualization beyond just text data.

## Selecting an Effective Niche: an Ecological View of the Success of Online Communities

### 1) a two sentence summary (do *not* simply summarize the work in your write-up)
The paper tries to shed light on the success and failure of new communities based on their niche, member and topic overlap. The authors have done a study using mixed methods research of a large corporate organization with 9000+ online communities. 

### 2) what you feel are the positives of the work, i.e. what is exceptional
The paper tries to prove a generally acceptable social phenomenon of the success of novel in online communities. The interesting result is that even if you are novel your success will depend on if you have an overlap with an already existing larger community. It also points out the need for specific topic based communities and how these various communities interplay with each other. Another interesting output of their analysis was of using both online and offline data to derive conclusions this resulted in better understanding of underlying community structure which might not be very apparent in online communities.

### 3) what you think could use improvement
I think one of the improvements in the study can be looking at what makes people change to new community. Also, when considering topic overlap does the hierarchy of the various topics have any effect on the community overlap ?

### 4) how you might continue the work or what you might pursue next
I might want to improve this paper by trying to answer 2 questions 1. What is the critical mass of people or percentage of people in existing community, which are required for people to create a new sub community and what results in a completely non overlapping community. 2. Does offline closeness of members of a community decrease the online community activity ?

## Thanks and Tweets: Comparing Two Public Displays
### 1) a two sentence summary (do *not* simply summarize the work in your write-up)
The paper addresses how various mediums of social interaction can be used for purposes other than they are intended for. It takes a case of people using twitter or a specific thank you board to thank people in their community.    

### 2) what you feel are the positives of the work, i.e. what is exceptional
The work identifies that platforms like twitter are more open ended and people usually find it confusing if they are asked to use them for a specific purpose. Also, a public interface like this allows people to be more cautious about what they post and how it will be perceived. Eventually the authors have suggested that using open platforms like twitter makes it easier for people to contribute in social communities.   

### 3) what you think could use improvement
I think the user could have use a research setup which has both displays at same time and would have considered the competitor effect of using one over another. 

### 4) how you might continue the work or what you might pursue next
I would want to extend their experiment with giving people a platform choice for SI Display where they can use any of their social identities like facebook, SMS etc compared to just using twitter. It would not only be interesting to see how this choice increases or decreases participation.

## CrowdScape: Interactively Visualizing User Behavior and Output
### 1) a two sentence summary (do *not* simply summarize the work in your write-up)
The authors propose a machine learning based approach to make crowd sourced tasks more efficient to evaluate. They try to solve the problem where the crowd is given more creative tasks which don't have a very strict pre defined answer.They propose taking into account behavioral aspects of each crowd user to determine the efficiency of tasks.

### 2) what you feel are the positives of the work, i.e. what is exceptional
This paper is interesting because it tries to specifically bring together visualization and machine learning. The visual interface is useful and provides rich insights into the crowd workers profiles and behaviors. The usage of behaviors of users is really important as it gives useful insights into how efficient each worker is. Their interface complies with the overview, zoom and demand on detail features which makes is user friendly.

### 3) what you think could use improvement
I think problem of crowd sourcing is  hard and does require a certain amount of human evaluation. The authors propose new features to help in this human evaluation but they can improve by allowing for some gold standard seed data which can guide the crowd workers an instant feedback on how their work might be evaluated and this will give a good incentive for them to improve their performance.

### 4) how you might continue the work or what you might pursue next
I might want to take their concept forward by driving instant feedback to users who are working on crowd sourced jobs about how good or bad their job is compared to a seed gold standard. This will help in revising their outputs and submitting a better solution.
