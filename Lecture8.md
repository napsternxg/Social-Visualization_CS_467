## AROMA: abstract representation of presence supporting mutual awareness
### 1) a two sentence summary (do *not* simply summarize the work in your write-up)
The paper discusses an augmentation technology called AROMA which is a combination of various technologies for communication. Their motivation was to find if abstract representation of activity gives a sense of remote presence for purpose of peripheral awareness. 

### 2) what you feel are the positives of the work, i.e. what is exceptional
One of the important features of this paper is their focus on their design question. The paper sets the tone initially itself by ensuring that they are not looking at all kinds of data set and factors of presence, instead they choose to stick to just the textual part of changes in the environment. 
Their approach is also really good as it uses images which have low demand on attention but enough information about changes at the remote site. 

### 3) what you think could use improvement
I think in the examples section of their paper they many times use references to non textual data points used for presence which diverts the reader from their original text based approach. They are concerned with the privacy issues but don't explicitly how they have achieved effective solution to privacy issues. Also, their examples for the prototype are less real world like and less crowded. They haven't talked about noisy data. 

### 4) how you might continue the work or what you might pursue next
I would like to pursue the topic further by looking into ways in how Machine learning techniques can be used in amplifying the classification of these changes using fewer sensors and more useful data. Another important feature would be to give the user a Filter to focus on just they peripheral changes they actually think interests them. 

## Metaphors We Live By
### 1) a two sentence summary (do *not* simply summarize the work in your write-up)
The paper tries to outline how metaphorical usage of language leads to people actually living the conversations as those metaphors. It tries to discuss how changing the meaning of metaphors may lead to different behavioral patterns. 

### 2) what you feel are the positives of the work, i.e. what is exceptional
I think the article sets the tone right at the beginning by explaining how using metaphors like Argument is War we actually start having conversations which treat other participants as opponents and try to win or loose the argument. I like the wide variety of examples the article gives which explain the various metaphorical usages. 

### 3) what you think could use improvement
I think the authors tried to explain their argument using very specific examples rather than using the general structure of the metaphors which is item1 like item2 and how the properties of various items can affect the explanation. They also have a huge assumption about direct impact of metaphor usage without considering external factors like culture, evolution and temporal features. 

### 4) how you might continue the work or what you might pursue next
I would want to extend this work by trying to come up with generic patterns in metaphor usage and using different category of part of metaphors change the behavior. I would also be interested in the temporal evolution of Metaphors especially in the new social media age. 

## Storytelling: The Next Step for Visualization
### 1) a two sentence summary (do *not* simply summarize the work in your write-up)
The paper focuses on how elements from storytelling can be the next evolution in visualization approach for data. Their focus is on how stories are easier to remember and convey message to a larger audience than plain unconnected data charts. 

### 2) what you feel are the positives of the work, i.e. what is exceptional
I think the theme of the paper itself is very important as it tries to use the fact that story telling should be an important part of data visualization. As stories have order so does any data or research methodolgy and hence stories can be more effective in describing the process. Also the focus on the non linear nature of stories is important. The example of Gapminder as purely visualization based story teller is very useful. 
They also talk about the temporal element of visualization which is important in making it a story. 

### 3) what you think could use improvement
I think the section on evalutation could have been written with a higher focus on newer content. They authors could have added more details on how to evaluate effectiveness of stories. Their content in each later section of the article from evaluation section is very less and could be expanded on. 

### 4) how you might continue the work or what you might pursue next
I think it would be useful to extend this work by looking into factors which influence the effectiveness of the stories and how they are percieved by the audience. It would be important to look into which elements of the story are important and what is their contribution to the effectiveness.
