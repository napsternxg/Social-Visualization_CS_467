## A review of overview+detail, zooming, and focus+context interfaces
### 1) a two sentence summary (do *not* simply summarize the work in your write-up)
The paper reviews the various researches in the field of interfaces and primarily focuses on their effectiveness. It has summarized various techniques of overview+detail, zooming and focus+context by giving examples, usage and background of each type. 

### 2) what you feel are the positives of the work, i.e. what is exceptional
The very first example of the scroll bar interface is useful in understanding its usage beyond just a  navigational component but also a component to overview and go into detail. In the zooming section it details the important study of undoing a zoom and why visual widgets for zooming are important. The part on zooming and panning is important in understanding the balance between the speed of animation and the ratio of zoom and pan for effective viewing. 
The focus and context part of the paper points slightly, the important aspect of what data to include. It also discusses the problems and uses of the fish eye interface which is very commonly used as a focus+context interface. 
The evaluation section of the paper is particularly useful in its efficient overview of important researches categorizing each of them based on the 3 categories and adding a brief description. 

### 3) what you think could use improvement
The paper almost covers everything about the recent researches in interfaces. I think it would have been interesting to evaluate the methods based on data needs and what kind of interfaces are best suited for a particular data format. There is a bit of mention of difference in source code data, map data and general word document interfaces but evaluating for general class of data would have been interesting.       

### 4) how you might continue the work or what you might pursue next
The work can be furthered by doing a data type specific evaluation of each of the techniques presented in the paper and how effective each is for a particular data type.      

## Choosing Colors for Data Visualization
### 1) a two sentence summary (do *not* simply summarize the work in your write-up)
The article outlines the usage of color in data visualization as a way to distinguish and group data points. It primarily focuses on the variation of color properties and right selection of color pallets to give maximum legibility to the visualization.     

### 2) what you feel are the positives of the work, i.e. what is exceptional
One of the important things the article mentions right at the beginning is to understand that color in visualization is not just the color of the data points which is used as a distinguishing factor, but, also the color of the background, border, scales and grid lines. The focus on the use of color to command attention in order of important goes a long way in identifying how to use a color. The article does a great job at explaining the various color measuring metrics like Hue, Value, Chroma, Tint, Tone, Shade etc and how difference in Value is the most important factor for legibility. The article also subtly highlights all along the important of making the color usage appropriate for both mediums (display and print). Finally, it provided a good framework for the user to create their own color pallet. 

### 3) what you think could use improvement
The paper was really good and succinct. However, it could have provided examples for other kind of visualizations apart from data charts like how google maps makes a great use of color to improve legibility. The article also focused a lot on white background variations, it would have been interesting to include at least one black background example which depicted good color usage.     

### 4) how you might continue the work or what you might pursue next
The work inspires me to look closely into how color and shape work together to improve legibility. Also, it would be interesting to know what complimentary pallet we have for black background for a given white background pallet.
