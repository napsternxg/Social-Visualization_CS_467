## Pumpkin and Partners Card: https://www.google.com/trends/correlate/search?e=p...
This is an example inspired from the latest episode of the last week tonight show by John Oliver, where the host claims that people only remember pumpkin during the Halloween month and for the rest year "November to August" they don't show interest in it at all. The surprising correlation is with the partners card which is a shopping card. 
It is easy to infer that the pumpkin consumption and usage increases during Halloween week however the partners card search is kind of weird. 

## Octoberfest and Costume for babies: https://www.google.com/trends/correlate/search?e=o.. 
This dataset is also interesting as there is a peak in the month of October which is the month in which Oktoberfest happens. The correlation is for USA. The correlation pattern is consistent for all the years in the dataset.
This is another interesting example correlation of without causation. I don't see why oktoberfest should lead to more costume for babies. Most probably because this is Halloween month and people are looking for costumes for their babies.

## Octoberfest and Quotes on Gandhi: https://www.google.com/trends/correlate/search?e=o...
This dataset is about searches in India. It is also interesting as there is a peak in the month of October which is the month in which Oktoberfest happens. However in India this month also has the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi hence people search about him a lot.
This is another interesting example correlation of without causation. Another important thing to note in this correlation is that the Oktoberfest line is at 0 before end of 2009 which was the year in which the first Oktoberfest happened in India.

## Ned Stark and Tower of Joy: https://www.google.com/trends/correlate/search?e=n...
[SPOILERS for GoT TV Series are coming, please read and peer review at own risk =) ]




This correlation is related to the storyline of the famous book series A song of ice and fire and its television adaptation Game of Thrones. The correlation tells a story about people's interest in Ned Stark and Tower of Joy only when the TV series started a few years ago in April 2011. 

Also, an important fact to note is that the peaks in the search for Ned stark and his related theories only started in July 2011 which was when the first season concluded with the beheading of Ned Stark. Tower of Joy is a very important storyline related to Ned which is useful in unravelling many mysteries in the TV series as well as the book series about the parentage of Ned's bastard son John Snow. We see the second major peak in the graph in 2013 which was the year when Ned's oldest son and a probably crowd favorite Robb was killed and the focus shifted back to his next younger son John Snow. Valar Morghulis.
