### Paragraph describing the compelling nature of the map:
The map describes an entertainment island in Singapore called Sentosa which is a huge tourist destination. The island is usually flocked by young people and families with kids on weekends and has a lot of entertainment options and monuments. I have used this map during my multiple visits to the island some years back. The map is compelling because of its use of kid friendly colors which describe the fun theme of the island. The map is small enough to be seen completely on a regular tablet device like iPad. 
The map describes some of the important landmarks by not just name but using overlay elements like the actual shape of the place which makes is very useful for tourist who are looking to move around places on the island. It also shows the various paths connecting the landmarks and what kind of transports are available on those. 
Since all names cannot be marked on the map, many of those are represented by legend numbers and colors based on their category and the description is listed at the bottom which are numbered in alphabetical order. Another important feature of the map is its division in grids from A-H horizontally and 1-4 vertically which serves as the equivalent of longitudes and latitude lines. 
Landmark 24 - Songs of the Sea is a show which involves light and firework show and has been aptly represented on the map to catch a tourists attention. The Merlion statue (14) serves as a major landmark on the map and since it can be easily see from far away in the island, this serves as a guiding point for many tourists. The map has been divided into many sections which are marked in bold on the map and help in easy location of places around the map. Since it is a tourist place, eating places, restrooms, bus stops and inquiry center are all marked using easy to understand icons on the map. The map also has a small overview map at the bottom which shows the major paths for moving around the island.
