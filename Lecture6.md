## Visualizing Social Networks
### 1) a two sentence summary (do *not* simply summarize the work in your write-up)
The paper tries to document the development of point and line method of social network visualization and how it has grown from hand drawn method to that of browser based computationally interactive representations.    

### 2) what you feel are the positives of the work, i.e. what is exceptional
I like the way the article was arranged using time period and specific developments during those time periods. The author has done a very good job of pointing out not just the advancement from one phase to another but also how the basic structure of social network visualization has been used consistently across various phases. The authors touches on the important tools and methods of each time period along with their dataset and example visualization which is useful in understanding the kind of problem each method was trying to solve.

### 3) what you think could use improvement
I think the author could have chosen 1 example dataset and also showed its evolution across various phases of development. Also, the author could have specifically pointed out some of the issues with network visualization about criss-crossing of edges which lead to less legible images. The author has also not mentioned the usage of network visualization for large network data.

### 4) how you might continue the work or what you might pursue next
Since this is a review paper I would like to expand it using some of the new methods which are useful in visualizing large network data from social networking websites. There have been a lot of methods to solve this problem using aggregation, filtering of nodes and edges. I would like to shed light on those.

## The Strength of Weak Ties
### 1) a two sentence summary (do *not* simply summarize the work in your write-up)
This was a revolutionary paper in which there has been emphasis on the important of weak ties over strong ties in social networks and how these weak ties are important in active as bridges between clusters and groups in the network.

### 2) what you feel are the positives of the work, i.e. what is exceptional
The key finding of the paper is exception and helps social scientists in not overlooking weak ties in networks. These weak ties form the basis of betweenness measures and result in the information flow model of network. The simplicity with with Granovetter has explained the fact that if strong ties exist between 2 nodes of a triad then at least a weak tie is likely to happen between the rest two, is remarkable and led to the theory of triadic closure.  He also brings forth the concept of local bridges in social networks which is useful for predicting future tie formation in networks.

### 3) what you think could use improvement
The paper is very well written and covers most of the important findings of its time. However I think it could have been improved by looking at the weak tie strength being affected by the closeness in size of neighborhood of the 2 nodes and how it affects the neighborhood overlap  and node participation in that edge. 

### 4) how you might continue the work or what you might pursue next
I would like to improve this paper by coming up with quantifiable measures for defining tie strength in network based on structural properties of a network and without using external node and edge attributes. 

## The Benefits of Facebook “Friends:” Social Capital and College Students’ Use of Online Social Network Sites
### 1) a two sentence summary (do *not* simply summarize the work in your write-up)
The paper describes some benefits of using friendships on Facebook and how it affects the social capital of individuals. The paper presents its results based on its survey of a small set of undergraduate students and identifies effects of facebook usage on bonding, bridging and maintained social capital.    

### 2) what you feel are the positives of the work, i.e. what is exceptional
The paper does a nice work of outlining the various kind of social capital and how it is linked to facebook usage.  It has an important observation of using Facebook to find offline connections online which is unique compared to the other reported studies of social network where people to meet online friends face-to-face later.

### 3) what you think could use improvement
I think tying facebook usage to self esteem using this small sample set is something which I will contest against. I feel they should have looked at a larger dataset including one which was more diverse, say, across multiple universities. Another issue is the facebook results they have collected are self reported and hence cannot be considered very accurate. 

### 4) how you might continue the work or what you might pursue next
I would like to expand this work by having a more Facebook data based and self reported study of the topic on a much larger audience across various demographics and age groups. This can be done by making a facebook app which collects user data and then making them fill a survey about their actual friend groups.
