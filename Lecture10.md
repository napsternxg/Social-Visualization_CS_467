## The Kinetic Typography Engine: An Extensible System for Animating Expressive Text
### 1) a two sentence summary (do *not* simply summarize the work in your write-up)
The paper tries to describe in detail the new technique for visualizing text using motion text also known as Kinetic Typography. It also shares the details on a new engines for creating kinetic typography for all platforms which is just limited to the film media currently. 

### 2) what you feel are the positives of the work, i.e. what is exceptional
I think the exceptional thing about this paper is its focus on addressing the problem of lack of platform independent Kinetic Typography making tools  and they have tried to solve it by giving away a platform independent tool for the users to use this technique to advance visualization works. The paper also describes the uses of using Kinetic Typography techniques in improving speed reading and comprehension and expressing emotions and tones. They talk in detail about using waveform generators for the kinetic effects. Also the authors point towards using principles from technical animations. 

### 3) what you think could use improvement
They do address the negative of the technique in demanding lot of attention from the user. I think the authors could have addressed the limitations of the engine for larger word processing and computing overhead attached to those. Also the authors do talk a bit about editing interfaces but have not in detail answered in detail about how such kinetic typography animations can be made with ease by anyone. 

### 4) how you might continue the work or what you might pursue next
I think a nice extension of this work will be to do a sentiment based waveform generator which also looks at the word content, context to determine its sentiment and visualize it accordingly in time fashion. Like sad words should animate slow in dull colors and happy words should be in fast in and stay and fast out animation style with bright colors.
