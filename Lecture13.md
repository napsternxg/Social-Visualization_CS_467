## Signals in Social Supernets
### 1) a two sentence summary (do *not* simply summarize the work in your write-up)
The paper talks about the framework using signaling theory for social networks and tries to understand their transformative potential to guide them in their design to become more effective as social tools. The paper also discusses the issues of trust, identity, cooperation and reliability prevalent in social networking sites based on the user's profile and costs related to connecting with more people. 

### 2) what you feel are the positives of the work, i.e. what is exceptional
I think the comment in the paper about SNS being in their very primitive stage of becoming transformative socal tools, is very accurate and helps in the build up of the argument the author presents for the need for a theoretical framework. The framework tries to solve important issues of defining a reliable identity and trust using the SNS profiles. The important point the paper makes about costs of using deception being too high to even restrict participation is interesting. The accompanying example of the police siren to speed through the traffic helps build the argument. The comment flow visualization is really useful in solving the trust issue to a certain degree. 

### 3) what you think could use improvement
A huge part of the process of building trust as suggested in the paper is by showing connections similar to oneself. I think this kind of argument is reliable in 2 ways connection networks where we connect with someone who want's to connect with us. In one way connection networks using this metric may over judge many profiles to be deceptive because people connect with a much diverse audience there. Another fact is that many people may want to keep their close connections offline and don't even want to share those online thereby using SNSs for connective with different people. The framework penalizes the above case for having diversity. 

### 4) how you might continue the work or what you might pursue next
I think the paper extends many important aspects of identifying trust and identity in SNSs. I would like to extend this work by looking at how this behavior is different on bidirectional cites versus unidirectional sites and what are the different kinds of signals which reflect identity on both these sites. 

## What I Learned by Building
### 1) a two sentence summary (do *not* simply summarize the work in your write-up)
The talk is about the experiences and learning of the speaker while building an visualization interface for data filtering called Data Sense for data visualization. She explains the various phases of data analysis and treats the visualization of data as the final form. She comes from anthropology background so she shares her experience of learning to work with data.    

### 2) what you feel are the positives of the work, i.e. what is exceptional
I think the moment about the concept of threshold being differently perceived from designer and the analyst is something really interesting the video explains. It is a problem which we all face working with diverse teams. Another important point mentioned in the talk is the fact that visualization is the place where people would like to do their data filtering. The concept of time being a different from each person is something really worth thinking about from data visualization perspective. 

### 3) what you think could use improvement
I think she says that visualization is the main thing which coveys the meaning of the data. I think there is scope for improvement of that judgement. A huge part of the meaning is for the technical people who would want to derive the meaning from looking at the data closely. The visualization is for people who are not experts in that data field. 
The concept of eyeballing complex data is interesting but a very tough and very sought after subject. The visualization they showed in the talk solving this concept is not very intuitive. 

### 4) how you might continue the work or what you might pursue next
I think I would want to use some of the concepts of her time perspective for individuals in my current visualization where at times highlighting a universal period is totally dependent on the people reading the visualization. Also, I would want to pursue their complexity resolution of the data concept by making the user identify the features they want to remove or add from the complex data as that is the first steps in the process. Also this approach is very data dependent.
